# üìä Transcript Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

A comprehensive interactive web application built with Streamlit for analyzing sentiment in financial documents, particularly earnings call transcripts. This tool leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to extract valuable insights from unstructured text and correlate them with stock market performance.

## üéØ Overview

This application employs a sophisticated hybrid sentiment analysis approach, combining VADER's rule-based methodology (60% weight) with FinBERT's domain-specific financial language understanding (40% weight). This dual-model approach provides nuanced, accurate sentiment scores tailored specifically for financial documents.

## üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture & User Flow

The application follows a three-page architecture with seamless navigation and persistent state management:

### Page 1: Upload & Configuration (`1_Upload_Files.py`)

**Purpose**: Initial data ingestion and preprocessing.

**Key Components**:
- **File Upload Interface**: 
  - Multi-file PDF uploader with drag-and-drop support.
  - Real-time file validation.
  - On-change callback triggers automatic preprocessing.

- **Stock Data Retrieval**:
  - The user enters a ticker symbol and selects a date range.
  - Ensure that the same company ticker and date range are used as in the uploaded files.

### Page 3: Correlation Analysis (`pages/3_Correlation.py`)

**Purpose**: Correlating sentiment data with stock market performance.

**Key Components**:
- **Data Synchronization**: Automatically fetches historical stock data and merges it with sentiment scores based on the quarter and year extracted from filenames.
- **Interactive Charts**: Dual-axis line charts to visualize the relationship between:
  - Stock Price vs. Negative Sentiment
